# GENERAL OVERVIEW 
## Purpose 
The purpose of the Business and Travel Expense Policy ("Policy") is to provide specific policies and procedures regarding Strata Identity, Inc. ("Strata" or "Company") business and travel expenses. This Policy applies to expenses that are directly paid by the Company as well as expenses reimbursed to individuals incurring them on behalf of the Company. This Policy is effective as of January 1, 2020. 
## Scope 
This Policy applies to all Strata personnel, including full-time, part-time, permanent, temporary, and contracted persons, seeking reimbursement from Strata. 
## Definitions 
•  Client: Any person or company that utilizes, or may potentially utilize Strata services, hardware, and/or software

•  MGR: An employee’s Direct Reporting Manager 

•  Employee: Full-time, part-time, permanent, and temporary personnel, as well as contractors and consultants performing work on behalf of Strata

•  Prior Authorization: A written or typed document showing request for, and MGR approval of an expense prior to its incurrence

Please note: All monetary amounts contained or referenced in this document are in United States Dollars 

## Reimbursement Policy 
It is Strata' policy to reimburse employees for ordinary, necessary, and reasonable expenses when directly related to the transaction of Company business. 

Directly related means:

•  There is an expectation to derive some current or future benefit for the Company. 

•  The employee is actively engaged in a business meeting or activity necessary to the performance of the employee’s job duties. 

•  There is a clear business purpose for the expense. 

## Responsibility 
Employees should exercise prudent judgment regarding incurrence of business-related charges. The primary responsibility for compliance with this Policy rests with the individuals requesting reimbursement and incurring the business expense, and the MGR that authorizes and approves these expenses. 

## Exceptions to Expense Policy 
Unless otherwise provided, an exception to any provision of this Policy requires written authorization from a member of Executive Management. 

Requests for Policy exception must move upward through each level of the reporting structure related to the individual desiring exception to this Policy. Requests for Policy exception must not be forwarded directly to Executive Management if such an action passes over a level in the organization's reporting structure. 

## Non-compliance 
Employees submitting expenses that do not comply with this Policy risk delayed, partial, or forfeited reimbursement. Disregard for Company Policy or altering of receipts can result in disciplinary action up to and including termination. 

## Issues 
Any questions or uncertainties regarding this Policy should be directed to the Operations Department. 

# THE EXPENSE REPORT 
The Expense Report must include the following items to qualify for consideration of reimbursement: 

## Expense Reimbursement Form 
Requests for reimbursement of business related expenditures must be submitted on a Strata Expense Reimbursement Form. This form should clearly identify the employee’s name, weekending date, MGR, and purpose in the appropriate field of the heading. A separate report should be prepared for each project. For extended trips, an Expense Report should cover no more than a seven-day period. 

The Expense Reimbursement Form is available, by request, from the Operations Department. 

## Substantiation Information 
In compliance with IRS regulations, Strata requires that all business expenses be substantiated with adequate records. These records must include information relating to the following: 

•  Amount of the expenditure

•  Date of the expenditure 

•  Business purpose (project name) of the expenditure 

•  Names and the business relationships of the individuals other than yourself, for whom the expenditures were made. 

The above information should be entered into the appropriate field in the Expense Reimbursement form. Expense Reports lacking any of this information will be returned to the originator. 

## Documentary Evidence 
All expenses must be substantiated with documentary evidence. Original receipts and legible photocopies of receipts are the only acceptable forms of documentation. Receipts must include the name of the vendor, location, date, and dollar amount. Itemized receipts are required for all meals purchased. 
Please note: restaurant chits, credit card receipts, and credit card statements are not considered an acceptable form of receipt. 
## Prior Authorizations

When required by this Policy, a written authorization must be obtained from the employee’s MGR prior to the incurrence of the expense. This authorization must accompany the Expense Report submission and be noted in the "Comments" field of the appropriate expense as “approved by MGR”. 

# EXPENSE REPORT PROCESS

## Timing of Submissions 
Expense Report submission is due within the sixty days following completion of the trip or incurrence of the charge. Strata recommends weekly submissions but has no obligation of payment if the Expense Report is submitted more than sixty calendar days after the date charges were incurred. 

## Expense Approval/Denial Process 

The Expense Reimbursement Form and all required documents are to be submitted to the employee’s MGR within sixty days of incurring the business-related charge. The MGR will approve the submission within five business days and forward all documentation to the relevant Operations personnel for processing.

If either the MGR or Operations Department rejects the Expense Report, written notification will be given to the employee immediately. The employee then has five business days to correct issues and resubmit. 

Expense Reports lacking sufficient documentation will not move forward in the approvals process until further documentation is provided. Items that do not comply with the Policy will be adjusted without notification and shall not be reimbursed. 

## Expense Reimbursement Policy  
Reimbursement will be made to the employee after the Expense Report is reviewed and approved by the MGR and Operations Department. The reimbursement check will be issued within two weeks of the final Expense Report approval. 

# SPECIFIC POLICIES

## Travel Arrangements 

To assist travelers, Strata has entered into an agreement with Travel Incorporated. This agency provides competitive rates, high-quality service, and convenience. Employees are required to book all business related accommodations and travel through this company. In order to optimize cost savings, arrangements should be made at least 14 days in advance, but not less than seven. As business travel plans change, it is not recommended to book more than 21 days in advance.

## International Travel 

All International travel must receive approval from a member of Strata Executive Management, prior to the incurrence of any expenses. 

## Conversion 

Employees shall neither convert nor apply the value of any form of transportation or accommodation purchased, or otherwise acquired for use by Strata, to any other purpose than the business related use for which it was intended. Likewise, employees shall neither convert nor apply the value of any form of transportation or accommodation purchased, or otherwise acquired for personal use, to any business related travel. 

## Transportation 

### Cost Efficiency 

Cost, convenience, and the specific situation must be considered when choosing a form of transportation. Employees are expected to use the most economical means of travel that meets business needs. 

### Airport Parking 

When using airport parking, employees should use the least expensive parking appropriate and available. Strata expects employees to utilize long-term parking lots, as short-term parking fees, valet, and covered parking will not be considered for reimbursement. Airport parking should not exceed seven days. 

### Public Transportation

The cost of necessary public transportation is considered reimbursable. All public transportation charges must be presented with a valid receipt. 

### Commercial Bus and Rail Travel 

Travel by commercial bus or rail is considered reimbursable. The class of travel for each is expected to be the lowest-priced coach fare available. 

### Taxi/Ride Share Use 

A taxi/Ride Share may be used for travel to and from the airport and during business trips. All taxi/Ride Share charges must be presented with a valid receipt. 

### Personal Vehicle 

Employees may utilize a personal vehicle for business travel if the reimbursement cost of mileage does not exceed the cost of other modes of transportation, (the Operations Department can assist with any uncertainties). Employees will be reimbursed at the prevailing IRS mileage rate per miles driven. This mileage allowance is in lieu of actual expenses for gasoline, oil, repairs, tags, insurance, and depreciation. Therefore, actual expenses for those items will not be reimbursed when your personal vehicle is used for business. Strata shall only reimburse employees for business miles incurred in excess of their normal commute. 

#### Documentary Evidence

Details regarding dates, purpose of trip, customer name, locations traveled to and from, and number of miles driven must be included in the “Comments” section of the Expense Report in order to be considered for reimbursement. 

#### Accidents 

Should an accident occur while driving a privately owned vehicle for business purposes, the cost involved for any needed repairs or resulting claims are solely the responsibility of the employee. Strata accepts no liability for damages or claims that may arise from the business use of a personal vehicle. 

### Rental Vehicle 

Employees may rent a vehicle for use on a business trip or for travel to a business destination. Compact and mid-sized are the only car classes considered reimbursable. A full-sized vehicle may be rented when three or more employees are traveling together or if an employee plans to transport clients. 

#### Documentary Evidence 

In order to be eligible for reimbursement, the receipt provided by the rental company upon the return of the vehicle, should be submitted as documentary evidence. This receipt should show make and model of vehicle rented, dates of rental, a detailed explanation of charges, and proof of payment. 

#### Fuel Charges 

Costs to fuel a rental vehicle while traveling for company related business are considered eligible for reimbursement. In order to minimize surcharges for the refueling of rental vehicles on premise, employees are required to return all rental vehicles with a full tank of gas. Prepaid fuel options will not be considered for reimbursement. 

#### Extras 

Any charges for optional equipment or services such as, child seats, ski racks, fuel, refueling, cellular telephone and other communication services, navigational services, satellite radio services, etc. shall be at the employee’s personal expense and will not be considered for reimbursement. 

#### Insurance 

When renting from a Strata preferred car rental company, all necessary insurance is included in the rental rate. Additional insurance may be accepted but will not be considered for reimbursement. 

#### Accidents 

Should an accident occur while driving a rental vehicle, employees without significant injuries should immediately report the incident to the local authorities, the vehicle rental company, and the Director of Operations at Strata. A police report should be filed in all cases. 

### Violation of Law 

Expenditures of, and relating to parking tickets, fines, or traffic violations incurred in a personal or rental vehicle are not eligible for reimbursement, even if these costs result from business travel. 

### Air Travel 

Employees must purchase economy class fares for all travel and accept the lowest logical airfare that meets business requirements. This is defined as the lowest nonstop fare with an arrival time within a two-hour window of the employee’s required arrival. Nonrefundable/penalty fares should be accepted when applicable, unless a valid business reason prohibits the use of such fare. Boarding passes must accompany all air travel receipts. 

#### Approvals 

Any airfare exceeding $1,000 must be pre-approved by a MGR. 

#### Advance Seat Selection 

Any fees associated with advance seat selection or assignment shall be at the employee’s personal expense and will not be eligible for reimbursement. 

#### Upgrades 

Only upgrades that do not increase the airfare or affect the ability to utilize a discount airfare will be considered for reimbursement. Any increase in price due to an upgrade should be at the employee’s personal expense. In order for the airfare to be considered for reimbursement, a quote documenting the price of an economy class ticket from the same flight must be included with the Expense Report submission. 

#### Checked Baggage 
For air travel less than seven consecutive days in length, Strata will reimburse the cost of one checked, but not overweight, bag. For air travel in excess of seven consecutive days, Strata will reimburse the cost of two checked, but not overweight, bags. 

#### Excess Baggage 

With prior approval from the MGR, employees may submit expenses for excess baggage charges, only in the following circumstances: 

•  When traveling with heavy/bulky materials or equipment necessary for business 

•  The excess baggage consists of Company records or property 

•  When traveling consistently for more than two weeks 

#### Lost Baggage 

The ultimate responsibility for retrieving or compensating for lost baggage lies with the airlines. Strata will not reimburse employees for personal items lost or damaged while traveling on business. 

#### In-Flight Wi-Fi

There must be a strong business justification for incurring any cost for in-flight Wi-Fi. Requests for reimbursement must be accompanied by a detailed explanation regarding business need. 

#### Overnight Delays to Air Travel

Should an airline delay necessitate an overnight stay, the employee must first attempt to secure complimentary lodging from the airline. If the carrier will not absorb the hotel cost due to a forced layover or other reason, reasonable costs associated with such an overnight stay will be eligible for reimbursement. 

#### Flight Change Fees 

Last minute changes before or during a trip which result in a higher airfare should be avoided. Flight change fees will not be reimbursed unless the change was due to a valid, unforeseeable business reason. 

#### Unused Tickets

Employees should report any unused airline tickets to the MGR and Operations Department. The unused fare should be applied to the next business trip requiring airline travel. 

#### Frequent Flyer Programs 
Many airlines have frequent flyer programs that reward travelers for their patronage. Employees may retain awards from such programs for future personal use; however, participation in these programs must not influence airline selection. Employees may use their own program rewards to upgrade but may not request a higher class of service in order to qualify for the upgrade. Employees will not be reimbursed for any miles, points or other rewards used or purchased in order to accomplish travel.

#### Charter Flights 

Chartering or using a personal aircraft for travel is not permissible and will not be reimbursed. 

## Lodging 

### Eligibility 

Lodging expenses are only authorized for employees that have been required to work and stay over 100 miles (one-way) from their usual base. Trips under this mileage require a compelling business reason and prior authorization from a MGR to be eligible for lodging expenses. 

### Length of Stay 

An employee’s lodging may not exceed five days without prior written authorization of the MGR or unless the stay requires more than 7 consecutive days with a client. 

### Reimbursement Rates 

Strata will reimburse amounts up to, but not exceeding, the per diem rates set forth by the U.S. General Services Administration (“GSA”), for applicable jurisdiction and fiscal year. Amounts in excess of these rates (not including associated taxes and fees) shall be at the employee’s personal expense. GSA’s published rates are available through www.gsa.gov, or by request from the Operations Department. 

### Documentary Evidence 

Receipts for lodging should include the name of the establishment, location, dates of stay and type of room rented. The entire detail bill must be included with the Expense Report submission. 
Any expenses included on the hotel bill (e.g., meals, phone calls, internet access, copies, etc.) must be separately identified in the appropriate sections of the Expense Report. 

### Internet Access 

There must be a strong business justification for incurring any cost for internet access in a hotel room. Requests for reimbursement of this type of charge must be accompanied by a detailed explanation regarding business need. 

### In-room Phone Use 

In-room phone charges are only permissible in emergencies. 

### Laundry Service 

For business related travel more than seven consecutive days in length, the cost of necessary laundry actually incurred on the trip is considered reimbursable. 

### Housekeeping and Maid Services 

Fees and tips for housekeeping/maid services will not be considered for reimbursement. 

### Ancillary Charges 

Ancillary charges incurred during the employees stay e.g., mini bar, in-room movies, gym access, etc., are considered non-reimbursable costs. 

### Hotel Cancellation 

“No-show” charges incurred due to a failure to cancel lodging reservations in a timely fashion will not be reimbursed. Charges incurred due to reasons beyond the control of the employee, e.g. airline delays, family emergency, client cancellation, etc., are considered reimbursable if adequately explained on the Expense Report. 

### Hotel Frequent Guest Programs 

Many hotels have frequent guest programs that reward travelers for their patronage. Awards from such programs may be retained by the employee for future personal use. However, participation in these programs must not influence hotel selection. Employees may use their own program rewards to upgrade their stay, but will not be reimbursed for such. If an upgrade is used, the employee must provide quotes to document the price of a standard, single occupancy room with the same dates of stay and at the same hotel, and include them with the Expense Report submission. Any membership fees associated with joining these programs are considered non-reimbursable. 

### Private Home 

While traveling for Company business, if an employee chooses to seek lodging with friends or family instead of a hotel, $30 per night, to a maximum of $60 per stay in recognition of their hospitality may be reimbursed. Prior authorization from a MGR is required. 

## Meals 

### Personal Meals during Business Travel 

Personal meals en route and at the business destination location are eligible for reimbursement. Personal meals are defined as meal expenses incurred by the traveler when dining alone on an out- of-town business trip. Employees are expected to spend $50.00 or less per day, inclusive of tax and gratuity. This includes all meals, beverages, and refreshments purchased during the day. Alcoholic beverages are not eligible for reimbursement. The suggested meal expenditures are $10.00 for breakfast, $15.00 for lunch and $25.00 for dinner. These amounts are guidelines and should not be considered a per diem. Meal receipts must include an itemization of food and drink purchased (a summary credit card receipt is not sufficient documentation). Multiple receipts for one meal should be listed separately. 

### Personal Meals for a One-Day Trip 

Meal expenses related to one-day business trips will be reimbursed upon substantiation of a valid business purpose. 

### Business Meals with Other Strata Personnel 

Employees will not be reimbursed for entertaining other Strata personnel unless there is a direct reporting relationship between them. The MGR has the authority to make a concession if a valid business reason arises. Meals must always be expensed by the highest-ranking Strata personnel in attendance. 

## Entertainment Expenses 

Entertainment expenses include events such as meals, golfing, theatre, and sporting events, whereby a substantial business discussion takes place with; Strata customers, prospects, recruits or vendors, either; during, immediately before, or immediately after the event. The employee to client ratio must not exceed 2:1. 
All extraordinary business meals or entertainment expenses that are expected to total over $500 must be given prior authorization by the MGR. All expenses expected to total over $1000 require prior authorization from a member of Executive Management. 

### Alcohol 

The use of alcohol for business entertainment purposes should be kept to a minimum. In the event an employee chooses to consume alcohol in connection with a business function, the Company expects that employees will act responsibly and avoid excess. Strata accepts no liability for an employee’s actions or any claims arising out of or in connection with the consumption of alcohol either during or after a business function. 

### Transportation 

If an employee has any concerns that he/she is not capable of safely driving after consuming alcohol at a business related event, Strata will reimburse the cost of alternative transportation to ensure that the employee does not place themselves or others in danger. Any employee, who is arrested and convicted of Driving Under the Influence, while performing Company business or returning from a business function is subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination. 

## Gratuities 

Reasonable tips included with a business meal or entertainment receipts are eligible for reimbursement. Tips in excess of twenty (20) percent and those in addition to pre-applied gratuity are considered excessive and will not be eligible for reimbursement. Nominal fees and tips to porters and baggage carriers are reimbursable as long as each instance is accounted for separately on the Expense Report. 

## Combining Personal Travel with Company Business Travel 

Any trips that combine personal travel and Company business travel must receive prior authorization from the employee’s MGR. 

### Transportation Costs 

When combining business and personal travel the employee may be reimbursed for the round-trip transportation costs incurred to and from a business destination only when the primary purpose of the trip is to conduct Company business. Transportation costs are considered entirely for business if the employee is required or requested by the Company to attend/engage in a business function, the travel would have occurred even without the personal travel component, and such travel has received prior authorization from the MGR. 

Any additional expenses incurred by the employee for deviating from the normal, direct route of travel between the point of origin and the point of Company business, or for stopping at an intermediate point for personal reasons, will not be reimbursed. If additional personal days increase the cost of transportation, the employee will be responsible for paying the difference. The employee must provide quotes to document the lowest available airfare for the direct route to/from the business destination occurring during the business portion of the trip and include this documentation with the Expense Report submission. 

### Other Costs 

The Company will only reimburse business expenses incurred during the trip. Reimbursements for meals, lodging, and other expenses in compliance with this Policy will be limited to those incurred during the business portion of the trip. Any costs incurred outside of the business activities will be at the employee’s personal expense. 

## Spouse/Companion Travel 

Strata will not reimburse travel or entertainment expenses incurred by, or on behalf of, an employee’s spouse or any other accompanying companion, human or animal. 

## Parking 

Strata will reimburse the cost of parking fees incurred on Company business. Acceptable parking charges include fees charged at hotels, offices visited, and airport parking lots. 

## Tolls 

The cost of tolls incurred while on Company business is considered reimbursable. All charges for tolls must be presented with a valid receipt. 

## Mobile Device Plan 

### Reimbursement Criteria 

Employees may be reimbursed for the business use of a personally owned mobile device plan, if: EITHER 

•  The position requires considerable time outside the office (travel, meetings, conferences, etc.) and use of the cell phone facilitates the effective conduct of business operations while away. 

**OR**

•  The position requires the employee to be immediately accessible to receive and/or make frequent business calls outside of working hours. 

**AND**

•  The MGR and Operations Department deem it necessary. 

### Documentary Evidence 

Once approved by all parties, the employee shall be eligible to submit a monthly statement for reimbursement. The statement should include a breakdown of charges by cell phone number and show billing/use dates. 

### Amounts Eligible for Reimbursement 

Strata will reimburse Field Sales Representatives for the use of a personally owned mobile device plan, up to $125.00. Inside Sales Representatives are eligible for reimbursement at $50.00 per month or the actual cost related to customer calls (the Inside Sales Representative will be required to provide the MGR with a justification for actual call reimbursement requests.) 

The amount eligible for reimbursement can be derived by adding the following: 

#### Calling Plan 

The Calling Plan, associated taxes, and normal usage fees for one cell phone line per employee, per usage period will be considered for reimbursement. In the case of family style cell phone plans, divide the dollar amount charged for the shared portion of the calling plan by the number of phone lines on the bill. Any other direct charges for the employee’s individual line should be added to the previously figured plan amount. 

#### Data Plan 

The Data Plan, associated taxes, and normal usage fees, for one cell phone line per employee, per usage period will be considered for reimbursement. In the case of family style cell data plans, divide the total dollar amount charged for the shared portion of the data plan by the number of phone lines on the bill and claim the applicable portion. 

### Amounts Not Eligible for Reimbursement 

Charges for services or items not related to normal business use shall not be considered for reimbursement. Such charges may include, but are not limited to, late fees, applications, disconnect/restoral fees, voice/data overages, directory assistance, equipment/phone purchases, mobile device insurance plans or deductibles, etc. Questions concerning amounts eligible for reimbursement should be directed to the Director of Operations. 

### Contractual Responsibility 

The Mobile Device Plan Policy is solely intended as a reimbursement for business use of a personal cell phone, the employee shall remain solely responsible for all payments and contractual responsibilities to the service provider. 

## Home Internet Plan 

Employees are not eligible for reimbursement of a home internet plan if they are located in areas where there is a Galvanize office or public WIFI . 

## Home Office 

Strata provides working space for all employees in the Galvanize office locations in Boulder, Austin, San Francisco and Vancouver and therefore does not reimburse expenses related to keeping a home office. 

## Commuting Expenses 

Travel from an employee’s residence to his/her normal place of business is treated as a commuting expense and is not reimbursable. 

## Books and Subscriptions 

Personal reading material, such as magazines, books, and newspapers will not be considered for reimbursement without prior written approval from the MGR. 

## Printing 

Most business-related copying and printing should be completed in office. Print jobs that are large in scale or require binding can be sent to an outside service. The cost of these services will be considered for reimbursement with proper documentation. 

## Shipping 

When required, the costs associated with packing and shipping of business materials will be considered for reimbursement. This does not include the shipment of luggage.

## Gift Matching

Strata will match an employee’s contribution at a rate of 1:1 to a maximum of $100 per employee, per calendar year. To qualify, the organization must be a nonprofit, public charity and hold a current 501(c) (3) tax-exempt status from the IRS. Qualifying charities can be found at www.irs.gov/charities. Gift matching is not currently in place as of this date.

To generate the match, a Gift Matching Request form should be submitted to the Operations Department, along with documentation of the contribution. This documentation may be in the form of a cash receipt or a bank or credit card statement and must show the date paid/posted, the name of the charity, and the amount of the contribution.
